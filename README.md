# GifTastic
[x] Before you can make any part of our site work, you need to create an array of strings, each one related to a topic that interests you. Save it to a variable called `animals`.
   * We chose animals for our theme, but you can make a list to your own liking.

[x] Your app should take the animals in this array and create buttons in your HTML.
   * Try using a loop that appends a button for each string in the array.

[x] When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

[x] When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

[x] Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
   * This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
   * Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.

[x] Add a form to your page takes the value from a user input box and adds it into your `animals` array. Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array remakes the buttons on the page.

[x] Deploy your assignment to Github Pages.

8. **Rejoice**! You just made something really cool.
