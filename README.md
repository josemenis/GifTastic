# How it works:

*   When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.

*   When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

* Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
   * This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
   * Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.
