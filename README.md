What I was not able to make happen:

1) Gifs do not load to the right when button is clicked.
All Gifs are stacked vertically

2) "Add a animal" button works but does not pull from Giphy correctly.
I could not figure out how to combine functions so I reapeated the fetch twice. Not able to accomplish "D.R.Y.".

3) Pausing Gifs not accomplished, copied code from solution but doesn't work.
